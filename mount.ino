/* ============== Description ================ */

/* Software now incorporates encoder feedback.
   Based on the same timer1 interrupt timing as
   v0.1, the interrupt now only increases a
   counter. The rest is done in the main loop in
   order to allow encoder- and other interrupts to
   work propperly. They are not detected while the
   ardu is handling an interrupt vector.
   
   STEPPER PINNING CHANGED!
   
   Every 17.2s the desired angular position is
   increased by 7.2Â°. Using the encoder data, the
   current position is obtained and the error
   between the two is calculated. This error is 
   then used to determine how many 4-step-groups
   the motor has to advance.
   
   If the desired position can not be reached, the
   software will enter an indefinite error loop that
   will flash the on-board LED. Camera-control and 
   battery-checking are not yet implemented.
   
   To minimize vibrations in the mount, the stepper
   increased speed for two full steps and then breaks
   for two steps at the end. In between it moves fast.
   This makes doSteps only viable for a count that is
   a multiple of 4.
